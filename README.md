# Roomz
Just some Room/Coroutines/ViewModel/Koin demo app always meant to be unfinished and trying to be up to date with all that fancy new best pratices.

## Libraries
AndroidX
Room 2.0

## Todo

Update tests with the migration.
Add some fancy MotionLayout, POs love some animations.
UI tests, could be fun.
Firebase remote config because why not
Room x Coroutines when you don't have to try 3000 lib versions to make it work (:
