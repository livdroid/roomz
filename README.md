# Roomz
Just some Room/Coroutines/ViewModel/Koin demo app always meant to be unfinished and trying to be up to date with all that fancy new best pratices.

## Libraries
AndroidX
Room 2.0

## Todo

Currently working on the insert-new-contact branch
Finish adding contact feature.

Update tests with the migration.
Add some fancy MotionLayout.
UI tests, could be fun.
Room x Coroutines when you don't have to try 3000 lib versions to make it work (:
